0. This license applies to any program or work which contains a

the terms and conditions of the Kellagroup OS Software License (KOSSL).
The "program" or the "Software", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
work of it. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the
output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. "You" and "your" means
any person who would like to copy, distribute, share, use or modify the
Software. "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Software or making it
accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to

documentation source, and configuration files for the Software.
